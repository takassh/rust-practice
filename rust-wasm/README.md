# What is this?
- the repository to learn rust and wasm based on https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html


## Memo

### Why you use rust with wasm, instead of JavaScript?
- For Low-Level Control with High-Level Ergonomics. Comparing to JS, rust with wasm can have low-level control and reliable performance.
- For small .wasm size
- Adoption is easy. Don't need to rewrite everything. You can start from the point which is important for performance.
- You can use JS tooling you love like npm and Webpack.
- For the amenities rust has: cargo, zero-cost abstraction and community!

### What is WebAssembly (wasm)?
- it's a smiple machine model and executable format.
- it's disigned to be portable, compact, and execute at or near native speeds.
- it has two formats to represent the same struct
    - `.wat` text format
    - `.wasm` binary format
- You can convert wat to wasm using [wat to wasm demo](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/)
- it has access to Liner Memory.
- it has no assumption on which it can run.

## About

[**📚 Read this template tutorial! 📚**][template-docs]

This template is designed for compiling Rust libraries into WebAssembly and
publishing the resulting package to NPM.

Be sure to check out [other `wasm-pack` tutorials online][tutorials] for other
templates and usages of `wasm-pack`.

## 🔋 Batteries Included

* [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating
  between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
* [`console_error_panic_hook`](https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook)
  for logging panic messages to the developer console.
* `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`: most Rust projects are licensed this way, so these are included for you
